# NC Games (React Project)

NC Games is a game review website, users can view reviews, up or down vote reviews and discuss/ comment on reviews. The logged in user also has the ability to delete their own comments.

The site has reviews which are divided into categories. When viewing reviews they can be filtered by the available categories, sorted by appropriate sort by values and the order of which they are shown can be toggled between ascending or descending.

React was used to build the this front end end project which consumes my backend api project.

## Navigating the website

This project has been built with a mobile first approach and scales with other screen sizes.

When opening the app you will be greeted with the homepage. You can use the burger menu to navigate to the reviews pages.

While looking at the reviews, these can be filtered by category, sorted by a sort value or have the order changed.

By clicking on a specific review, this will bring up the whole review and associated comments. It gives the ability to add more comments as the logged in user and up or down vote the review. The logged in user can also delete their own comments.
